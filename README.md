# Basic Features:

* Possibility to withdraw your experience into a bottle.
* Add a single experience bottle to add in, for example a Crates Plugin.
* Share experience among other players.
* Fully customizable messages and prefix.

# Supported Server Versions:

WithdrawExp supports for now only 1.17 versions of Bukkit / Spigot.

**Note** *that this plugin is created for a **CraftBukkit / Spigot** server, so this plugin might not work on a modded server like Tekkit etc.*

Other **CraftBukkit or Spigot derivatives/forks** might work, but are not officially supported. So if you run into issues while using those, try to reproduce your issue on a fresh and up-to-date Spigot server first.
